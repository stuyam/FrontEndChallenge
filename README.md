Sourcery front end developer challenge

I built two options using css and tapped into the current js implimentation to show and hide certian parts of the search depending on the size of the screen.

####Option 1 (master branch)
This option adds a search button next to the phone button. When you tap it, it displays the search options under the nav bar. The advantage to this is that it is not ver invasive to the screen, and it is only there if you need it.

####Option 2 (lightbox-search branch)
This option uses the same search button as option 1 but when you tap it, it fades in a "light box" that covers the screen and diplays nothing but the search information. To close the search you tap the "x" in the top left corner of the page. The downside to this is that you have to close the light box before scrolling down the page.
